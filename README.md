This repository holds keyboard designs made to be 3D-printed and handwired, and libs to speed up the designing of new boards.

## Exporting

To export a 3D-model, you need the OpenSCAD software and a text-editor.

Open the .scad file you wish to export models from in your favorite text-editor.

Firstly you can edit the parameters at the top of the file to customize the designs to your liking.

The designs usually consist of two or more parts, so you will need to comment out all but one part, then render and export it, and repeat for all other parts.

## 3D-printing

All designs should be able to be printed without supports and the recommended layer height is 0.25mm. This is especially important on the plate as rounding errors can cause the switch to not snap in properly.
